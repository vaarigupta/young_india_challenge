                            <p>As per the National Employability Report 2013 for India, 47% graduates are not employable in any sector of the knowledge economy. Situation has not improved till today. It is said that if you end up with a boring miserable life because you listened to your mom, your dad, your teacher, your priest or some guy on television telling you how to do your stuff, then you deserve it.</p>

                                After speaking to thousands of young people from diverse groups and backgrounds, we believe that we have reached a point in our development where the new generation is demanding a dynamic education, corporate and social system that allows them to do what they love. There is a need to create a transformational culture that allows people to reach their fullest potential and be truly happy and content with the work they do and how they live their life

                                    YIC speakers, mentors and jury are some of the most distinguished individuals in their field of work. They come from extremely diverse backgrounds ranging from business, culture, social development, media, publishing, academics, startups, personal growth, dance and music and many more. The idea is to connect you with inspiring individuals who can connect with your passion and choice of career, guide you to make the right decisions and also offer some work opportunities to explore your areas of interest.
